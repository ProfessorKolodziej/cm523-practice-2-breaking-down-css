# Practice 2: Breaking Down CSS

In this practice, you'll learn how to translate a small design to basic CSS by looking at a design like a developer. This practice builds on Practice 1: Breaking Down Design. If you have not completed that practice, you should complete it before beginning this assignment. The goal of both these practice problems is to prepare you to look at your own designs in Figma, break down the complex pieces that might give you trouble, and recreate them in CSS. 

## Prerequisites
- Practice 1: Breaking Down Design is complete.

## Requirements to Complete This Practice
- [ ] You've imported your fonts in your HTML from Google Web Fonts. This will help recreate your typography.
- [ ] You've used `display: grid;` in your CSS at least once. This will help recreate your layout.
- [ ] You should only use class selectors in your CSS. Do not use element selectors.
- [ ] You should not change the tags, classes, or content in the `index.html` file. For example, do not change "Find the grid and use it" to lowercase letters. Use CSS to style this instead.

### New concepts

- **CSS Selectors:** A way of finding elements of HTML and applying styling to them. You have many options for this. For this practice, only use class selectors. [CSS Selectors Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php)
- **CSS Grid:** One of several options you can use to lay out your design in CSS. It's a powerful tool with many options that are good for most layouts. We'll focus on defining column templates to keep it simple for now. [Learn more here](https://learncssgrid.com/)
- **Web fonts:** You can use web font services, like Google Web Fonts, to add a custom font to your website. We'll use the HTML approach for this practice. [Here's how to add Google Web Fonts to your page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-your-next-web-design-project-e1ad48f1adfa/) If you do not add the fonts to the HTML and CSS, even if you can see them on your own computer, others won't be able to see the font - so it's important to add any custom fonts to your HTML.

## Instructions

Please review the tutorial videos on Blackboard in this week's folder. Then, you should try to recreate your Practice 1 assignment using the same steps. Use the instructions in Blackboard to complete this assignment.
